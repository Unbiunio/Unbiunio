# 👋 Hi everyone! I´m Rafa Serichol


I’m really fascinated about how fast technology is evolving and how data and AI are going to change our lives in the future, making things easier for us. But we have to be careful and resist the temptation to let technology and AI do everything for us; otherwise, we might just end up digging our own graves and let then decide our fate.
